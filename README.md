# Parkinson's Monitoring System

This project was developed during the **H2AI Hackathon** as a comprehensive medical tracking system for monitoring Parkinson's disease patients. It integrates multiple services including real-time data processing, secure storage and a web dashboard for doctors. The system leverages modern web technologies and machine learning to support medical professionals in diagnosis and ongoing monitoring.
